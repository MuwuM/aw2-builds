title: About Accessibility Wars Too

## Our Mission

We are a community of Guild Wars 2 gamers with accessibility needs.  We aim to help accommodate a wide range of needs, from
physical to cognitive. To this end, with the help of the community, we publish and archive low-intensity (LI)
builds that can allow players to solo more difficult content, and comfortably contribute in group play.

## The Builds

> These builds are designed to be exceptionally easy to play in solo content, or with open world groups.
> These builds are fluid, and you should consider the builds listed as a starting point or guideline.
> Play around with different traits, skills, and weapons at your leisure.
> Think about if builds are power or condi, and try not to mix the two (often).
> Some folks find more defense is more comfortable, while others are more comfortable when they can burst down enemies.
> These builds are about enabling you to find your own comfort zone in the game.
