This LI Core Ranger build has good variation, allowing for greatsword mobility, longbow range, or axe dps.

## Tier Notes

Start at 1, work your way down the list.

1. Auto attack and use 5 (axes) or 2 (greatsword / longbow)
2. As in 1, + 3 (axes) or 5 (gs, use after 2) or F2 (longbow)
3. As in 2, + F2 or 5 (longbow)
If comfortable with the above, consider dropping Signet of the Wild for Frost Trap.

## Gearing

- Marauder Armor
- Runes of Vampirism
- Knight Trinkets
- Greatsword Force/Accuracy
- Axe/Axe Force/Accuracy

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Blood can provide an extra 200 hp/s. Axe/Axe, Longbow, and Greatsword all work. If using Longbow take "Lead the Wind" in Marksmanship for piercing.
