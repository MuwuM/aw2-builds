This relatively low-intensity Herald build is melee-ranged, but brings a bunch of defensive options for those tough moments.

## Tier Notes

1. Keep Facet of Darkness and active for fury and auto-attack. Choose Facet of Strength (more dps) or Facet of Chaos (Defense) as well. If using Shiro or Jalis, maintain Impossible Odds or Hammers respectively instead.
2. As in 1, + use sword 2 off cooldown. 
3. As in 2, + legend swap (f1) any time your energy hits 0. This allows you to maintain more facets in glint.

Can choose to camp either offhand sword (useful teleport) or shield (+60 toughness and useful block). 

If comfortable with the above, use Sword 4 off cooldown. The full version of this build is one of the easiest DPS builds to play in the game, so its recommended to take a look if you want to move further up the tiers.

## Legendary Stances

These are all options. Also see Variants below:

- Glint/Shiro (boons + dps)
- Shiro/Jalis (dps + defense)
- Jalis/Glint (defense + boons)

## Gearing

- Full Marauder
- Rune of Vampirism
- Set 1: Sword/Sword Force/Air
- Set 2: Sword/Shield Force/Air

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Blood can provide an extra 200 hp/s.

Pick your Legend from Glint, Shiro, or Jalis. In each one you will maintain specific upkeep skills while activating the same set of sword/x skills. Generally, I recommend Glint as it strikes a great balance between damage and defense.
