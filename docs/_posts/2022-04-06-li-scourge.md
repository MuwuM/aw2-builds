![image-left](/assets/icons/scourge.png){: .align-left} This is a LI Scourge build provided by jupiter. It has a lot of variation, and centers around supporting yourself and your minions with the scourge's shades.

## Tier Notes

Start at 1, work up the list.

1. Use 1 and 5 off cooldown. Maintain your shade uptime by using F1 somewhat frequently.
2. As in 1, + 3
3. As in 2, + F5 (OR: Change Bone Fiend to Blood Is Power and use that off cooldown).

Once comfortable, experiment with changing traits. Either Blood Magic or Death Magic can be swapped for Curses (top/x/bot, mid/x/bot, or x/x/mid) or Soul Reaping (top/x/bot, with x being top or mid). It is also beneficial to eventually work on using as many of F2-F4 as is comfortable if using the Soul Reaping variant, as Dhuumfire has a 1 second ICD and when proc'd deals quite a lot of DPS.

## Gearing

- Full Celestial
- Runes of the Nightmare
- Scepter/Torch Strength/Earth

## Variants

The sigils are pretty loose in this build, so use what you like. Blood is about +200 hp/s, malice is higher dps than earth over long fights. Cele can be replaced with Viper (higher dps), Trailblazer (higher tank), or Dire (budget). If using Dire swap sigils to Agony + Venom. Runes can be swapped for Rune of the Tempest or 5x Trapper + 1x Black Diamond. There are many trait variants, which are noted in the Tier Usage.
