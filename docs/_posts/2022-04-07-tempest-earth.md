This elemental and signet-heavy Tempest build allows you to focus on just a few weapon skills.

## Tier Notes

Start with 1, and work your way up.

1. Use 1 and 5 while summoning elementals.
2. As in 1, + 2
3. As in 2, + F4 + Signet of Earth

Once comfortable, experiment with adding 3 (Dagger mainhand only) and Signet of Fire. Use 4 as an emergency defense button.

## Gearing

- Full Celestial
- Runes of the Krait
- Scepter/Warhorn Strength/Blood

## Variants

The sigils are very flexible so pick what you like. Cele can be replaced with Viper (higher dps), Trailblazer (higher tank), or Dire (budget). If using dire, swap sigils to Bursting + Agony. Dagger can be used in place of Scepter for a good AOE option.
