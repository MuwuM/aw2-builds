![image-left](/assets/icons/daredevil.png){: .align-left} This Daredevil build is a a little more on the moderate side of difficulty. Follow along the tier notes to find your spot.

## Tier Notes

Either Staff or P/P can be used. 

1. Auto-attack. Spam 2 (Staff) or 3 (Pistol). 
2. As in 1, + time dodges to line up with initiative dumps if using Bounding Dodger. If not using Bounding Dodger, there is no further complexity. 
3. There is no further complexity. Focus on avoiding attacks. 

If comfortable with the tiers above, experiment with replacing Infiltrator's Signet with Pitfall or Fist Flurry and using the skill off cooldown. "

Bounding Dodger can be exchanged for Unhindered Combatant for extra mobility. Either Staff or Pistol can be used with this build.
