This is a core engineer LI build provided by jupiter. This build may also be viewed at [gw2skills](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PegAoqlZw6YMsEWJOULaJfA-zxIY1ohvMSIBCsAkfA-e).

## Tier Notes

Start at 1, work up the list.

1. Use auto-attacks off cooldown. Drop your turrets and group mobs near them.
2. As in 1, + spam F2 (Flamethrower Toolbelt) off cooldown.
3. As in 2, + occasionally drop Flamethrower for a moment to use Pistol 4.

Once comfortable, experiment with removing 1-2 turrets and using Elixirs like Elixir U and Elixir B in their place.

## Gearing

- Full Celestial
- Runes of the Traveler
- Pistol/Pistol Strength/Smoldering 

## Variants

Celestial can be swapped for Viper (higher dps), Trailblazer (higher tank), or Dire (budget). If using Dire, change runes to Balthazar. Alchemy -> Inventions may be worth testing due to the number of turrets in this build.
