This higher intensity melee-oriented Berserker build is more complex than most LI builds.

## Tier Notes

The baseline to make this build work is higher than most LI builds.

1. Autoattack. Use F1, 2, and For Great Justice off cooldown.
2. As in 1, + change your heal to Blood Reckoning and use it directly after Arc Divider.
3. As in 3, + Signet of Rage

If comfortable with the above, add 4 and 3+5 to your rotation. Play around with more DPS-oriented traits. Against certain bosses, consider changing a signet for Wild Blow for heavy cc.

## Gearing

- Full Marauder armor & trinkets
- Runes of Vampirism
- Marauder Greatsword Strength/Accuracy

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker or Knight, though knight will perform considerably worse.

Keep your sigils the same on this one, as crit is very important and strength is a must due to MMR synergies.

Arms can be traded for Tactics (more sustain, slightly more active) or Discipline (more DPS, much more active).

Eternal Champion can be taken for more passsive defense but is a very large DPS loss.

Defense can be traited for much more passive defense, and may be recommended if you find yourself struggling with the base build.
