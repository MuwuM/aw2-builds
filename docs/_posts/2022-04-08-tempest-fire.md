This spicy Fire Tempest build uses the teamwork of elementals combined with a few signets to keep the complexity down. Great for barbeques.

## Tier Notes

1. Use 1 and 5 while summong Elementals.
2. As in 1, + F1
3. As in 2, + Signet of Fire

Once comfortable, experiment with adding 2, 3, and signet of earth. Try to add in 2 after 5 or F1.

## Gearing

- Full Celestial
- Runes of Balthazar
- Scepter/Warhorn Bursting/Blood

## Variants

The sigils are very loose on this one, use what you like. Celestial can be replaced with Viper (higher dps), Trailblazer (higher tank), or other various options. Dire is good on a budget, but you will need to run a Smoldering Sigil instead of Blood and change the "Burning Fire" trait to "Burning Precision". Arcane can be traited in place of Earth, just don't activate Signet of Stone if you do. Most shouts are pretty good as alt utilities.
