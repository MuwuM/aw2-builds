With the power of Balthazar, elementals, and a single unchanging weave (no element swapping), this Weaver build is an accessible way to light everyone and everything on fire.

## Tier Notes

1. Camp Fire + Earth. Use 1 + 2 while summoning elementals.
2. As in 2, + 3 + Primordial Stance
3. As in 3, + 4 + Signet of Earth.

Once comfortable, explore options such as swapping between Fire/Fire, Fire/Earth, and Earth/Fire.
