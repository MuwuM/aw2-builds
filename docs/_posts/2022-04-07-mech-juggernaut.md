This Mechanist build makes stuff blow up and light on fire. What could go wrong?

## Tier Notes

1. Use auto-attacks off cooldown. Pick a mech skill and spam it. 
2. As in 1, + spam another mech skill OR use 2 off cooldown.
3. As in 2, + spam elite signet

Once comfortable, experiment with dropping flamethrower for short times to use Pistol 4, and Pistol 2/3 if using mainhand pistol.

## Gearing

- Full Celestial
- Runes of the Traveler
- Mace/Pistol Strength/Smoldering

## Variants

Mace or pistol mainhand, doesn't matter which. Celestial can be swapped for Viper (higher dps), Trailblazer (higher tank), or Dire (budget). If using Dire, change runes to Balthazar. Luck Sigil combined with the passive from Swift Signet may be pretty fun to try.
