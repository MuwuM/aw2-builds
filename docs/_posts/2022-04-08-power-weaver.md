This signet-heavy Weaver build sets up a single weave. There is no element swapping necessary, reducing the complexity of Weaver greatly. That said, this build is one of the more intense builds on the site.

## Tier Notes

Camp Air Mainhand and Fire Offhand.

1. Auto-attack + use 3
2. As in 1, + 2
3. As in 2, + swap to fire/air and use 2. 

If comfortable with the above, consider swapping Bolstered Elements to Weaver's Prowress and/or swapping water or earth signet to Primordial Stance.

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Accuracy is a large DPS boost over Blood. Water or Earth signet can be replaced with Elemental glyph or any other utility of your choice.
